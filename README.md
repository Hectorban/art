# Generative Art in Rust with Bevy

This repository contains a collection of generative art projects created using the Rust programming language and the Bevy game engine. Currently, there are two examples available:

1. **N-body Simulation Visualizer**: A visualization of an N-body simulation, where multiple celestial bodies interact with each other through gravitational forces.
2. **3d Fractals**: A 3D mandelbulb 

You can find the visualizations at [https://alysanne.dev/art](https://alysanne.dev/art).

## Getting Started

To run the projects, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-art-rust-bevy.git
   cd generative-art-rust-bevy
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   cargo install
   ```

3. Run the desired visualization:

   ```
   cargo run --bin <name_of_the_visualization>
   ```

   Replace `<name_of_the_visualization>` with the name of the visualization you want to run, such as `n_body_simulation` or `3d_fractal`.
